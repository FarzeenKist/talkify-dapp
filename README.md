# TALKIFY

Talkify is a podcast hosting platform that allows creators who enjoy having their voice heard to store and broadcast their content on the blockchain and listeners who want to get inspired with new ideas and solutions to their problems can listen and increase the ratings of a podcast by tipping the creators. 

> To get started as a content creator upload your audio to an ipfs cloud and deploy the contract.

Since Talkify is deployed on a blockchain network it ensures that your site does not face any slowdown or overload due to its large audio files and make your work easily accessible.
